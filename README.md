# Blazor.Confetti
A small service that can make confetti in your Blazor application. Works for both WASM and Server render mode.

![Showcase](./docs/confetti.gif?raw=true)

# Demo
The sample project can be demoed at https://kristofferstrube.github.io/Blazor.Confetti/

On each page, you can find the corresponding code for the example in the top right corner.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
You need to install .NET 8.0 or newer to use the library.

[Download .NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Installation
You can install the package via NuGet with the Package Manager in your IDE or alternatively using the command line:
```bash
dotnet add package KristofferStrube.Blazor.Confetti
```

# Usage
The package can be used in Blazor WebAssembly, Blazor Server, and Blazor WebApp projects both with interactive WASM and Server render modes.
## Import
You need to reference the package in order to use it in your pages. This can be done in `_Import.razor` by adding the following.
```razor
@using KristofferStrube.Blazor.Confetti
```

## Add to service collection
The library has one service which is the `ConfettiService` which can be used to start a confetti animation. An easy way to make the service available on all your pages is by registering it in the `IServiceCollection` so that it can be dependency injected in the pages that need it. This is done in `Program.cs` by using our extension `AddConfettiService()` before you build the host like we do in the following code block.
```csharp
using KristofferStrube.Blazor.Confetti;

WebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Adding other services

// Adding our service
builder.Services.AddConfettiService();

WebApplication app = builder.Build();

// Configure middleware

app.Run();
```

## Renderer
For the confetti to appear somewhere we also need to place a component at the root of our application which will work as the drawing space for the confetti animation. A good place to do this could be in `MainLayout.razor` after all other markup. If you are creating a Blazor WebApp you might need to add the attribute `@rendermode="InteractiveServer"` to the `Confetti` component to make it interactive.
```razor
@inherits LayoutComponentBase
<div class="page">
    <div class="sidebar">
        <NavMenu />
    </div>

    <main>
        <div class="top-row px-4">
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/" target="_blank">About</a>
        </div>

        <article class="content px-4">
            @Body
        </article>
    </main>
</div>

<!-- This is the part that we add. -->
<Confetti />
```

## Injecting and activating the confetti service
Now we are ready to inject the `ConfettiService` in one of our pages or components to make some confetti.
```razor
@inject ConfettiService ConfettiService

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="Activate">Celebration ðŸŽ‰</button>

@code {
    private void Activate()
    {
        ConfettiService.Activate(new());
    }
}
```

With the above we create confetti from the bottom of the page with all the default settings. We can further customize the confetti colors, amount, origin, speed, and speed variation.
```razor
@inject ConfettiService ConfettiService

<button @ref=button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="Activate">Celebration ðŸŽ‰</button>

@code {
    private ElementReference button;

    private void Activate()
    {
        ConfettiOptions options = new()
            {
                Colors = ["silver", "gold", "#B87333"],
                Pieces = 500,
                Mode = ConfettiOriginMode.FromElement,
                Origin = button,
                Milliseconds = 2000,
                VariationInMilliseconds = 500
            };

        ConfettiService.Activate(options);
    }
}
```
